 SmallBytes is a responsive web-app that is use to **compress /  decompress** files containing different formats. It **compress / decompress** following formats:

- TXT
- TIFF

The Front-End of the App is made in [ReactJS](https://github.com/topics/react-js). Also a CSS framework [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/topics/tailwind) is used here for styling. The Compression Algorithm that is used in *SmallBytes* is **Lempel-Ziv** compression which is a Dictionary-based algorithm. I made this app for a University Project.

**Front-end Demo**: https://small-bytes-dawoodmalhi.vercel.app
