 SmallBytes is a responsive web-app that is use to **compress /  decompress** files containing different formats. It **compress / decompress** following formats:

- TXT
- TIFF

The Compression Algorithm that is used in *SmallBytes* is **Lempel-Ziv** compression which is a Dictionary-based algorithm. I created this Web app as 4th Smester Project of AOA(subject).
